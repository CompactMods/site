# I don't have any machines in creative/JEI/REI/EMI!
Compact Machines 7 introduced *Room Templates*, a system for allowing new machine/room types to be registered in datapacks, so that mod pack makers have more control over their content. To match this, the basic room sizes you are used to have moved to a datapack built in to the mod.

If a modpack has not enabled the built-in pack or provided any templates of their own, see [[CM7 ‚Äê Enabling Basic Room Templates]] for more information.

# Where did Tunnels go?
Tunnels, a system for moving items/fluids/energy in and out of rooms, has been stripped from the mod. They had numerous issues since CM4, and a better system (Room Upgrades) is planned for a replacement.

[You can track progress on Room Upgrades here.](https://github.com/orgs/CompactMods/projects/8/views/2)
