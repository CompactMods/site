# Compact Machines 3 Information (pre-1.16)

## Personal Shrinking Device
This little tool allow you to enter your Compact Machines. Right clicking a Compact Machine world will teleport you inside.
It also doubles as the integrated documentation. Just right click it anywhere else.

 
## Spawn location
By default you spawn in the center of the room. You can change this by shift-right-clicking a Personal Shrinking Device at the location you want to set the spawn to.

Make sure not to obstruct the spawn location, there is currently no mechanic that automatically searches a better spawn location. And you don't want to have to break the blocks you spawn in.

## Recovery
If you accidentally deleted your Compact Machines block with all your stuff still inside the Machine it can be recovered using the following command: 

`/compactmachines3 machines view`

It allows browsing through all existing Compact Machines and also provides a button to give yourself a Compact Machine Block linked to the viewed machine. Be aware that this breaks already existing links, i.e. if the machine should already exist somewhere it is being disconnected from the room.

This command only works for server operators.
